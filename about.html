                    <p>This day, I got the acceptance letter from an university in the US that I had thoroughly researched and hoped to get in. The moment was really cheerful, proud and, "relaxing". Besides all the normal feelings ones can get when got admitted into their loved school, Why did it feel so relaxing to me?<br> <br>
                      Let's go back much further, before I even started my application, 5 months before this day, I was still playing FIFA games on Playstation 4 with my friends, missing out attendances at school, did not care a bit about my interests and career. The whole high school time of mine was just like this, just like a guise, claiming the moment as a "make up" for the hard work I had done to get into my dream high school <br> <br>
                      Not until my best friend, Khiem, introduced me to some basic programming tricks he was on a few days, did I find something intrigued, and, really jealous, as at the moment, I realized myself had been falling behind, seeing my best friend had already started out on his journey, his path to his goals. Khiem had helped me a lot, putting me off any distractions, and I started to learn programming, finding it amazed and set path to pursue Computer Science in the US. <br> <br>
                      I even founded an environmental project with Khiem, as both of us are really aware of the environmental problems, and we really want the knowledge to widespread to the community. The experience was fun, especially going to a coastal town in Haiphong and educating many kids about marine pollution & how to protect it!

                            Back to the moment of joy when I finally received the admission after 05 months of realization, self-development, and determination to purse a target. 05 months seem fair to everyone, but to me, it is incredible, for an aimless kid to a senior student writing essays & prepare everything 18 hours a day (biggest truth) during the Covid to study abroad in the US. <br> <br>
                            Yet, 03 weeks later, a bad news made me really broken down, my parents told me that I wouldn't be able to go to the US this year, because of paperwork problems, which they claimed to be their faults. I can't stand the news, also can't blame my own parents for the problems, but it is only myself understanding that hardly did I have made up my mind, crammed and worked hardly to pursue the goals, to be denied the opportunity by an external unexpected problem. <br> <br>
                            I spent the whole next month feeling unmotivated, uneased, and again, directionless. But when it came to solutions, they would all be the past distractions, games, basketball, hangouts. But seeing my friends progressing with their dreams everyday, I self-reflected, and realized I couln't be such a quitter like this, but needed to deal with problems, not just stayed there whining. <br> <br>
                            I made up my mind again, redirecting to studying both Business at Foreign Trade University, and Information Technology at RMIT University. I tried myself again, still keeping the passion for programming, but now, I would delve more into the world of Business.

                      <p>Firstly, I partcipated in my first ever Hackathon with my <br> friends, with attempt of trying ourselves with the <br> knowledge of business, especially startups. But <br> unexpectedly, we got into the Top 10 with our Edtech <br> product, which I haven't even achieved before, which <br> was exactly the turning point for me. Exactly at that <br> moment, I felt myself an unbounded aspiration for <br> startups, where everything seems unexpectedly fit, from <br> the willingess to solve societal problems, the application <br> of technology, to the business skills. <br> <br>
                        Since then, I created and led a team of 05 friends of <br> mine, who didn't know their future goals and <br> directionless just as myself before. Here, I took the lead,  <br>created a studyspace where everyone can learn new <br> skills & knowledges that fit their interests. Together, we <br> have participated in many startup competitions since <br> the Hackathon, but as mere freshman in one of the most <br> competitive university, we lost every single one of them. <br> But it was nothing of a failure, as we have in exchange <br> tried out many startup ideas, with different business <br> models and industries, in exchange, we have learned a <br> lot and developed for ourselves many skills during the <br> time! <br> <br>

                            Exactly 01 year since the day I got the admission letter, I achieved the Top 01 Sustainability Track at HackYouth competition with my team. After all the hard work and the knowledge, skills, experiences piled up over months, we finally proved ourselves with a product, which we really believed in, and we really wanted to make it happen. <br> <br>
                            After the competition, we keep developing the product, validating the idea through many more competitions, receiving mentorship and advices from many succesful individuals in different industries. We even got another Top 01 at another Tech Hackathon, competing against with all the seniors, even there are many international teams. <br> <br>
                            Along the journey, the team still learn essential skills & knowledge to develop both ourselves and projects, while I am always actively recruiting many other talented individuals from different universities, from FTU, NEU, HUST, UET, to UEH in Saigon. Now that the team has grown a lot, together has created and kept developing many projects in different industries, from Sustainability, F&B to MedTech <br> <br>

                      <p>I am also the Member of External Affairs of Tomorrow Entrepreneur Clubs (TEC FTU), the number 01 club in FTU, where I got the opportunity to build connections with many C-levels, Founders of large enterprises, successful startups in industries. Here, I found myself other core strengths, which is sales & project management, through sponsorship invitation and organisation strategies & implementation for the biggest startup competition for young people in Northern Vietnam, the Kawai Business Startup competition. <br> <br>
                        Looking back 01 year, from an aimless kid, now I have had unbounded aspiration for startups, striving for success, solving the societal problems with my own tech products. Along the journey, I am also actively working as an intern at big companies and work for startups to refine my knowledge and connections, so that I can be much fitter piece to build the startup day by day. <br> <br>
                        But this is not a proud feeling, yet it is a feeling of responsibility, assurance and determination. With many things I have worked hard to achieve in just 01 year from just nothing, and even another time of getting directionless, I see in myself the potential to grow much more. If I keep this pace of growth for myself, not only winning against every peers and seniors, but I also can recruit, work with them to develop my startups, push them hard to become one of the faces of startups in Vietnam in the near future. <br> <br>
